# blockchain-new12
This code represents a simple blockchain implementation in Rust. It defines the Block structure with its properties, a Blockchain structure to manage the chain, and includes basic functions for adding blocks and calculating the block hash. The code also includes a simple demonstration in the main function where blocks are added to the blockchain, and the blockchain is printed.

Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and building a complete, secure, and performant blockchain requires additional considerations, such as consensus
